# Getting An Overview

## Understanding the requirements
When designing an architect, you will need to determine the functionalities that it will need to provide and also how it should behave taking into account of the cost involves.
- What should the system do
  - Search Box
  - Look at Reviews
  - Look at Products
  - Check Out page
- How should it work
  - Maintainability (how long the program suppose to last)
  - Scalability (how many users going to be needed to serve)
  - Reliability (when is the uptime)
  - Efficiency (how long it takes to load)
- Restrictions
  -   Cost
 
## Priotisation
Once requirement gathering is completed, there will be a need to understand what to priotize based on the requirements. Such as focusing on scalability which will reduce portability.

## Designing Architecture
Common Architecture Design Patterns
- Layered Architecture
- Event Driven Architecture
- Microkernal Architecture
- Microservice Architecture
- Space-based Architecture
